# Deeplearning.ai-solutions
The repository contains the solution for the specialcisarion in deep learning by Andrew Ng..

The codes have been written in jupyter notebooks along  with results.

I highly encourage students to try solving by yourself before looking into the solution.

### Following courses have their solutionn.

  1. Neuaral Networks And Deep Learning.
  2. Hyperparamets Improving and Optimisation
  3. Convolutional Neural Networks
  4. Sequence Models
